# artwork (by yours truly)
this repository contains art that was created by me during #arcade (by hack club) sessions. this art can be experienced by all and is completely open source. i mostly use ibispaint x for any art since i do not own a tablet / ipad / drawing tablet (i want one so badly though) and draw with my fingers on my android phone.

some of my art can be seen in the folders for my projects. here's such examples of my pixel art :
