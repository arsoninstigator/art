# artwork (by yours truly)
this repository contains art that was created by me during #arcade (by hack club) sessions. this art can be experienced by all and is completely open source. i mostly use ibispaint x for any art since i do not own a tablet / ipad / drawing tablet (i want one so badly though) and draw with my fingers on my android phone.
