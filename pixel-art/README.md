# pixel art project(s)
these are about an hour (or three) long small projects that i draw on my phone (android) using sandbox & pixilart and my fingers. i do paint by numbers and also create my tentative sprites using the same apps since it works better for pixel art as compared to what i generally use for art (ibispaint x on android).

to #ship these projects, i have made this experienceable for all. you can just download the final .png from github and print it out to create stickers for personal use etc.
